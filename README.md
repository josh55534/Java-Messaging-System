# Java Messaging System
## What is this?
This was a side project I made after taking Database Systems in 
Fall 2021. The winter break after that I decided to work on a small
project hooking a simple java program up to a SQLite database file on
my computer. The program itself allows users to create profiles with
passwords and log into the system. Once logged in, users can input
another user's username and send a 300 character message that user.
Users can also read messages they have received and messages they have
sent to other users.

## Dependencies
I used a java library that allows Java's JDBC to work with SQLite databases.
